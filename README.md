VBA challenge

The VBA code has been uploaded.

The original Excel file size with the macro code was too big and couldn't upload to this Github so you can access the file via this Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Slrw1g9mgye6iD5W0TwZh2eYmIUiVruy?usp=sharing

The picture file 2018 is the answer for year 2018. Similarly other files for year 2019 and 2020

There were 2 loops created. The first loop was to create the 1st table from the original data source. The 2nd loop was for pulling data from the first loop.
